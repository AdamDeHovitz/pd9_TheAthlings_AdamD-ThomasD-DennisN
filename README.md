Welcome to Guess my Thing!
Guess my Thing is an attempt to create a learning machine that will ask you questions about the titular "thing" 
that you are thinking of, and based on the attributes you say that it is, the machine will take a guess as to what
the thing is. If the machine is right, that's great! But what's way cooler is when the machine is wrong. The computer
will then ask you what the thing you were thinking about was and then add it it's list of objects. In this way, we have
a slightly intelligent computer that actually learns the more you spend time with it.
To use guess my thing, simply pull all of the files from our repo, enter "javac *.java", then "java Driver".
From here, instructions and prompts will be provided in the terminal itself. As a quick recap of those instructions, first 
the computer will welcome you and ask you to pick a save file from which to load a list of objects. For the starting 
demonstration, we recommend animalsTest.txt, a basic list of a a few animals and attributes, but one with the potential for 
growth. Following this, the computer will ask you to either play, save and quit, or just quit, all relatively 
self-explanatory. If you play a round, the computer will ask you a series of questions as described earlier, culminating
with a guess as to what the object is.
